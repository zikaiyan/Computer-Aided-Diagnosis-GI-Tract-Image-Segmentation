# 6.8300 - Advances in Computer Vision Course Project

This course project is adapted from the Kaggle competition found here: [UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation). Please follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

## Dataset Setup

Follow these steps to download and prepare the dataset for the project:

### Download the Dataset

1. **Visit the Kaggle Competition Page**:
   - Navigate to the [UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation competition page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation).

2. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Click on the "Download All" button to download the dataset zip file.

3. **Place the Dataset in the Project Folder**:
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file.
   - Move the extracted folder to your project directory.

### Prepare the Data

1. **Rename the Extracted Folder**:
   - Rename the extracted dataset folder to `datasets` to maintain consistency with project scripts.

By following these steps, you will have the required data ready in the appropriate format and location for further processing and analysis.
